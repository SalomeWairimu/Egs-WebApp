        The Equity Global Scholars Program program allows students whose talent and promise exceed their financial resources to complete their education. With a vision that education is a catalyst for social and economic change, the program focuses on developing leaders who are transformative, encouraging them to be active contributors in their communities.

        The Program provides financial, social, and academic support to Scholars. Financial support includes, but is not limited to, tuition fees, accommodation, books, and other scholastic materials. The scope of majors and degrees eligible for the Equity Global Scholars Program varies from institution to institution.

      We share a common vision of a world where everyone has the opportunity to learn and prosper. We value our differences and our similarities. We respect, trust, and support each other. We strive to be humble and empathetic and to always act ethically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our work begins with listening. Based on what we learn, we determine plans that align with the aspirations and needs of those we work with.The insight of young people shapes our work, and their voices and ambitions continue to play a central role in all that we do. We work with African governments, the private sector, educators, and other funders to design holistic solutions to address the youth employment challenge.
